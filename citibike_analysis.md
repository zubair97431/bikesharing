# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

I addressed the second question that had to do with gender variances in Des Moines as well as NYC and how
that will correlate with the effect on possible businesses in Des Moines. 
Both appeared to be great locations for citibikes but due to the gender bias, Des Moines might be the 
viable option. 

## NYC Data

Working with the data for NYC, it seems great on surface level and bikes may bring business to the current shops available in the city. However, data shows that more males are of existance in the city than females and this shows that males would be the dominant citibike users. If less females are using citibike, it wouldn't necessarily hurt businesses but businesses that prosper with selling items for females won't profit as much. On the male side, businesess would be booming and that is why other cities may need to be explored, hence Des Moines.   

### Des Moines Data

From the Gender Breakdown Data and also researching the IOWA census data, it appears women are close to 60% available in Des Moines and this is why the city might be a viable option to help the growth of businesses all around. More women riding bikes brings more businesses to the industry of feminine items. Using the tourist page also helped to determine this information as it showed data for gender. Citibike should invest within the IOWA city of Des Moines for better growth and properity, not only for itself but for the city as a whole.
